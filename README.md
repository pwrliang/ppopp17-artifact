Groute: An Asynchronous Multi-GPU Programming Framework
=========================================================

Groute is a multi-GPU programming model and framework, implemented over CUDA. 
The framework is designed to optimize the implementation of irregular algorithms 
over a single node with multiple GPUs, and does so with an asynchronous approach.

Research
--------
Groute is the framework behind our PPoPP 2017 paper [[paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018756)][[pres](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~msutton/groute-ppopp-2017-pres.pdf)],
and is still under active development.
